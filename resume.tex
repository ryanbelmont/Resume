\begin{rSection}{Design Projects}
	
	%Chess Assist
	\begin{rSubsection}{Chess-Assist - Language: Java}{\bf June 2021 - Present}{}{}
		
		\item When complete, Chess-Assist will be a comprehensive tool designed to assist chess players with studying and drilling the opening phase of chess theory where there is a universally excepted but often complex "best" move order at the start of a game
		
		\item In its current state, Chess-Assist is a fully functioning chess application that allows for two player games via the command line
		
		\item Future and current plans for Chess-Assist are to integrate communication with a python program which will run the Stockfish chess engine, allowing the user to play single player against known best moves for the opponent. The chess engine will also analyze all moves made by the user, and when the user makes a move that is considered sub-optimal Chess-Assist will automatically restart the current opening line. This will allow users to get fast repetitions with immediate feedback when drilling new openings
		
		\item Chess-Assist is a designed around object oriented Java with logical inheritance for each component of the game
		
	\end{rSubsection}
	
	%jOS
	\begin{rSubsection}{32 Bit Operating System - Language: C}{\bf February 2019 - May 2019}{}{}
		
		\item Worked with a partner to design a simple 32 bit operating system using C and IA-32 assembly without any library dependencies
		
		\item Gained an intensive understanding of low level programming and the importance of efficient and accurate memory management
		
		\item Explored the concept of context switching by implementing a round-robin interrupt driven preemptive thread scheduler
		
		\item Utilized C pointers and structures to implement a functioning ext style Ram Disk file system with read and write capability
